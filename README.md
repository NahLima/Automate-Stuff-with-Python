Floating point "floats" = 10.5

- The Boolean data type has only two values: True and False (both beginning with capital letters).
Comparison operators compare two values and evaluate to a Boolean value: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
== is a comparison operator, while = is the assignment operator for variables.
Boolean operators (and, or, not) also evaluate to Boolean values.
